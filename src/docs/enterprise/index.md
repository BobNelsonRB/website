# Getting started with AppVeyor Enterprise

## Introduction

AppVeyor Enterprise is a downloadable version of [AppVeyor CI](https://www.appveyor.com) that can be installed on your own premises behind the firewall. AppVeyor Enterprise is a great solution for organizations willing to use AppVeyor for testing their applications in a fully controlled environment. While hosted AppVeyor CI service saves you from managing your own build environment, AppVeyor Enterprise has its own benefits:

* Compliance with organization security requirements
* More powerful build worker VMs when you need them
* Custom build worker images with proprietary or 3rd-party licensed software
* Any number of concurrent jobs for maximum parallelism
* Scalable workers so that when you require a different number of workers at different times you don't have to pay for concurrent jobs when you are not using them. Check [this blog post](http://www.mindkin.co.nz/blog/2017/8/8/scale-your-ci-by-the-minute) from our customer.
