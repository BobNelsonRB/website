    <h1>About us</h1>
    <h2>AppVeyor aims to give powerful Continuous Integration and Deployment tools to every .NET developer without the hassle of setting up and maintaining their own build server.</h2>
</div>

## Why are we building AppVeyor?

Current CI tools for .NET developers are somewhat frustrating. They were built to work with all languages and stacks,
leaving you with tons of settings, and they are lacking Continuous Deployment functionality. That leaves you with the difficulty
of setting up a build server, configuring complex software and figuring out deployment strategy on your own.

Everything is moving to the cloud today. We prefer to keep our sources in a cloud and host our apps in a cloud
because it’s easier to set up and maintain, and costs scale with the business. Why can’t we have another tool living
in a cloud to integrate our code and deliver apps to the customer?

Enter AppVeyor - the fastest way between your code and a hosting environment of your choice.

We want to build a Continuous Integration tool with an awesome user experience, so intelligent, so tailored to .NET applications
that it takes minutes to connect to your repository and push green builds to your environment - it just works!
